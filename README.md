sample-chatbot-rust
===================

Rust language implementation of QuickBlox XMPP Chat bot 

Use Cargo guide to compile and run a bot http://crates.io

This is an early version of a QuickBlox Chat bot written in Rust. For now this bot does nothing, it only connects to the QuickBlox Chat. More functionality will be available eventually, but may take time.

Waiting for https://github.com/Florob/rust-xmpp lib implementation.
